This is a repository that contains the source data and all the code required to reproduce the analysis used for the manuscript Estimating cue rates for animals with silence-burst sound patterns by 
Tiago A. Marques, Sónia Coelho, Ana Isabel Leal


The paper describes a new way to estimate cue rates for scenarios in which animals might present silence-burst sound production patterns. It is illustrated with :bird: Common Chaffinch ($Fringila coellebs$) dataset collected in Companhia das Lezirias, Santarém, Portugal in 2022.

Essentially a placeholder for now, more details will follow as we update/develop this git repository.
